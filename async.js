// ? Async functions are a way to work with asynchronous way. They are built on top of promises and are syntactic sugar for promises



// Creating a promise
const pizzaPromise = ( ) =>  {
    return new Promises((resolve, reject) => {
        //resolve and reject are caliback functions
        // what is callback function?
        // A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be "called back" at a later time.
        let order = true;

        if (order) {

            setTimeout(( ) => { // setTimeout is used to simulate a delay 
                resolve("After 5 seconds, Pizza delivered!");    
            }, 5000);
         } else {
            setTimeout (() => { //setTimeout is used to simulate a delay
                reject("After 5 seconds, Pizza not delivered!");
            }, 5000);
        }
    });
}


// calling teh function with a promise
// use.then() to handle the resolved promise 
// use.catch() to handle the rejected promise
pizzaPromise()
    .then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });

    console.log("Waiting for you pizza...");

// Terminology 
// Promise: An object that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asychronous operation and its resulting value.
// Resolve: A callback function that is used when the promise is fulfilled.
// Reject: A callback function that is used when the promise is rejected.
// .then(): A method that is used to handle the resolved promise.
// .catch(): A method that is used to handle the rejected promise.
